# 🏥 CarePlus – Healthcare Microservices Platform

CarePlus is a full digital healthcare ecosystem designed to connect **patients, doctors, assistants, and pharmacies** in a single integrated platform.  
The system provides appointment booking, prescription management, pharmacy ordering, AI-powered tools, real-time communication, and multi-role dashboards — all powered by a modern **microservices architecture**.

CarePlus was developed as a **Final Year Project**, but structured like a real production-ready healthcare system with clean separation of services, event-driven communication, and modular, scalable design.

# 1️⃣ Introduction
CarePlus solves the problem of fragmented healthcare services. Instead of using separate applications or manual processes for appointments, prescriptions, and pharmacy orders, CarePlus brings all key operations into one connected system.

Patients use a mobile app or WhatsApp bot to book appointments, doctors use a web dashboard, pharmacies receive digital prescriptions, and AI modules support decision-making.
